      <p className="aboutme__text--1">
        As a Frontend Developer with a degree in Food Science and Technology, I
        combine my passion for technology with my interest in programming.
      </p>

      <p className="aboutme__text--2">
        I have experience in creating responsive, user-friendly, and accessible
        websites using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, REST-APIs, among
        other web development tools. I have worked for Content Stadium, a
        leading platform for creating and publishing templates for social media
        content, where I used Typescript, MySQL, Bitbucket, HTML and Photoshop
        to develop and maintain the front-end features and functionalities. I
        also collaborated with a diverse and international team of developers,
        designers, and project managers, following Agile/Scrum methodologies and
        best practices. I am a curious and fast learner, always striving for
        improvement and eager to take on new challenges.
