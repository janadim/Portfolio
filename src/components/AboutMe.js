        Coming from the laboratory technician background, I found the pandemic
        as a game changer in my professional carreer. I used this time to
        reassess my carrer path around IT and programming. Today, programming
        for me means{" "}
        <span className="aboutme__text--hl">
          creation, expression and personality
        </span>{" "}
        in itself. At first I was curious about it and shortly after I got
        passioned for its{" "}
        <span className="aboutme__text--hl">limitless possibilities</span> and
        the freedom that it provides.

        I have experience in creating responsive, user-friendly, and accessible
        websites using HTML, CSS, React, Figma, Node.js, REST-APIs, and other
        web development and design tools. I have worked for Content Stadium, a
        leading platform for creating and publishing templates for social media
        content, where I used Typescript, MySQL, Bitbucket, HTML and Photoshop
        to develop and maintain the front-end features and functionalities. I
        also collaborated with a diverse and international team of developers,
        designers, and project managers, following Agile/Scrum methodologies and
        best practices. I am a curious and fast learner, always striving for
        improvement and eager to take on new challenges.
