        Coming from the laboratory technician background, I found the passion
        within the IT and programming world. Programming means{" "}

          creation, expression and personality
        </span>{" "}
        in itself for me and I have felt immersed for its{" "}
        <span className="aboutme__text--hl">limitless possibilities</span> and
        the freedom that it provides.

        I have experience in creating responsive, user-friendly, and accessible
        websites using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, REST-APIs, among
        other web development tools. I have worked for Content Stadium, a
        leading platform for creating and publishing templates for social media
        content, where I used Typescript, MySQL, Bitbucket, HTML and Photoshop
        to develop and maintain the front-end features and functionalities. I
        also collaborated with a diverse and international team of developers,
        designers, and project managers, following Agile/Scrum methodologies and
        best practices. I am a curious and fast learner, always striving for
        improvement and eager to take on new challenges.
